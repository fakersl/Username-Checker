## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/00ie/username-checker.git
cd username-checker
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: the `requirements.txt` includes the `requests[socks]` extras so SOCKS proxies (socks5) are supported if your environment installs the extra dependencies (PySocks). If you prefer to install the SOCKS support separately run:
```bash
pip install requests[socks]
```

3. (Optional) Configure proxies:
Create a `proxies.txt` file in the root directory with one proxy per line. Supported formats:
```
host:port
user:pass@host:port
http://host:port
socks5://host:port
```

The app includes a builtin proxy manager and a GUI panel (Bulk tab) where you can add/remove proxies, run a check to validate them and clear the automatic blacklist. Proxies that fail checks are added to `bad_proxies.txt` (blacklist) and shown in the GUI in red.

4. (Optional) Configure Discord webhook:
Edit `config/settings.json` and add your webhook URL:
```json
{
    "webhook_url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE"
}
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python main.py
```


### Bulk Checker

1. Select platforms to check from the sidebar
2. Set the number of usernames to generate and their length
3. Click "GENERATE LIST" to create random usernames
4. Click "START CHECKING" to begin the bulk check
5. Available usernames will be displayed in the console with green highlights
6. Export results using "EXPORT RESULTS" button

### Sniper Monitor

1. Switch to the "SNIPER MONITOR" tab
2. Enter the target username you want to monitor
3. Set check interval in seconds (default: 60)
4. Click "ACTIVATE SNIPER" to start monitoring
5. The tool will continuously check if the username becomes available
6. You'll receive Discord notifications (if configured) when it's available

## Configuration

Edit `config/settings.json` to customize:

```json
{
    "threads": 5,
    "timeout": 10,
    "webhook_url": "",
    "use_proxies": false,
    "jitter_min": 0.5,
    "jitter_max": 1.5,
    "platforms": {
        "instagram": true,
        "github": true,
        "pinterest": true
    }
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **threads**: Number of concurrent checking threads
- **timeout**: HTTP request timeout in seconds
- **webhook_url**: Discord webhook URL for notifications
- **use_proxies**: Enable/disable proxy rotation
- **jitter_min/max**: Random delay between requests (in seconds)
- **platforms**: Enable/disable specific platforms

## Changelog

### Version 1.0.0

- UI refinements:
    - Replaced the static sidebar layout with a resizable divider on the Bulk tab (uses a PanedWindow) so the sidebar no longer leaves an empty vertical line and can be resized by the user.
    - Eliminated thin border artifacts between adjacent panels by removing highlight borders on card containers.
    - Sidebar scroll area was fixed so its scrollbar stays flush with the panel and content resizes correctly.
- Usability:
    - Console and main panel now expand reliably when the window is resized.
- Performance:
    - Kept existing batch-update optimizations for log rendering and proxy list population.
- Discord webhook integration
- Proxy support
- Export functionality

### Version 1.0.1
- Improved proxy management UI and features:
    - Dedicated "PROXIES" tab with a table (Proxy / Status).
    - Visual status column showing "BAD" for blacklisted proxies (red text).
    - Button to remove a single selected proxy (with confirmation).
    - Button to clear the blacklist (with confirmation).
    - New button "REMOVE BAD" to remove all blacklisted proxies from your proxy list at once (with confirmation).
    - Export button to write `good_proxies.txt` and `bad_proxies.txt` from the GUI.
    - Proxies are validated at application startup (background task) if `proxies.txt` exists.
    - Supports SOCKS proxies when `requests[socks]` (PySocks) is installed; SOCKS proxies will be auto-marked as bad if SOCKS support is missing.
    - Proxy checker now integrates with the blacklist automatically (bad proxies marked, good proxies unmarked).

## Version 1.0.2

- **UI responsiveness**: Reduced UI freezes when switching tabs by batching heavy UI updates and limiting global bindings.
- **Proxy list optimization**: Proxy table population is now incremental to avoid blocking the main thread.
- **Minor UI tweaks**: Version label updated and README adjusted.


## Version 1.0.3

- **Performance improvements**: Optimized core engine and proxy checker.
- **Instagram verification**: Added session ID support for improved username verification on Instagram.
- **Stability**: Enhanced error handling in platform checkers.
- **UI refinements**: Better visual feedback and responsiveness.

## Version 1.0.4

- **UI refinements**: Improved layout density.
- **Performance**: Optimized batch updates and rendering.
- **Code cleanup**: Removed all inline comments for cleaner codebase.
